# Beyondvideoapp
This Project is authored by Vaibhav Shringarpure as part of Beyond's Front End Task. It uses Angular version 6.0.3

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your local development machine in order to run the project locally
```
* Node JS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Angular CLI - Run npm install -g @angular/cli
```
### Coding Styles
We use 4 spaces in our Text Editor for indentation of code

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Dist Folder
Please DO NOT edit files directly in the 'Dist' Folder. All application code is worked from 'SRC' folder within the project. This folder is included in the source control just incase the user doesn't want to install and dependencies and node packages and just run the compiled version on their local server
